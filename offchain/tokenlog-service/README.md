# Tokenlog Service (scaffold)

This placeholder is meant to evolve into a Tokenlog-inspired snapshot service. It will track proposed GitHub issues and map them to Commons token balances before forwarding a ranked list to the DAO.

## Structure
- `index.js`: exports helpers to fetch balances and build mock issue scoring data.
- `config.json`: links to the GitHub placeholder repo.
